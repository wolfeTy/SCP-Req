# SCP-Req
SCP:SL Plugin for EXILED 1.11 (soon to be updated to 2.0.1) that allows players to request to be an SCP next round, has a cooldown of one round before you can use the command again. Each SCP request will replace a naturally spawned SCP with the player that requested the role. The naturally spawned SCP will either be set to a ClassD or Scientist.

# Permissions:
SCPReq.req -- allows the player to use the command.

# Config:
SCPReq_enable -- Currently the only config option, obviously to enable or disable this plugin, default is true.

# Commands:
scpreq | req -- in either the remote admin console, or the local console - if using the local console you'll need to add a period before sending the command (ex: .scpreq | .req)
